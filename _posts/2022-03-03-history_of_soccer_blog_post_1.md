Like most things, soccer started as a free-flowing game that was enjoyed amongst everyone. But, nourished by human nature and imperialist and capitalist trends, the game of soccer would not stop evolving and optimizing until it reached the highest, most competitive form of the sport. When the sport of soccer transitioned into an industry, team managers and intentional game tactics made a rise. In the 1920s, arguably one of the most influential tactical innovations in soccer history was made famous by Herbert Chapman in the 1920s: the WM formation. The WM formation became the standard of European soccer for many years and had a course-altering impact on the future of soccer. As the sport of soccer caught fire amongst the rest of the globe, the WM formation was inevitable in dictating and influencing team tactics and soccer in other regions of the world. Different regions, at different points of their soccer development and investment, would take established formations and morph them into something else, sometimes more dangerous, due to the quality of their players and nature of culture. This WM formation from Europe would eventually, in the 1950s, aid in the creation of Brazil’s dynamic and lauded ‘diagonal’ formation tactic.

Before the creation and establishment of the WM formation, most soccer was played with a formation that consisted of five attackers (forwards), three half-backs (mid-fielders), and two defenders (full-backs): the 2-3-5 formation. This formation, as the numbers depict, was a very offensive-centric formation – a lot of success rested on the five attackers applying pressure on the opponents defense. However, with that, came a weak defense that was susceptible to counter attacks.The WM formation was revolutionary in a sense that it built a balanced formation with three defenders, two wing-halves, two inside-forwards, and three attackers. The re-weighting of the field provided more defense to stop enemy swift counter attacks, and relied on the consistency of the middle of the field – the wing-halves and the inside-forwards [1]. The WM formation was far more adaptable to teams with varying strengths due to the concentration of players in the center of the field. These center players were responsible for managing the flow of the game by marking opponent wingers and supporting offensive pushes – a versatile role for such players.

The WM formation was not just theoretically successful – the formation was pivotal in helping England win the World Cup in 1966. England actually set a new record for lowest average goals scored per game by a World Cup winning team – a testament to the defensive ability of the formation. The WM formation, by success and nature, began popping up in many other European teams, including the 1934 World Cup winning Italian national team. This formation was a significant departure from the 2-3-5 formation, which had become outdated due to its defensive vulnerabilities.

However, despite its success in Europe, the WM formation was not well-suited to the Brazilian style of soccer, which was more dynamic and free-flowing. In the 1950s, newly promoted Brazilian coach Flavio Costa adjusted the WM formation to suit the intrinsic talent and athleticism his roster and players possessed, creating the ‘diagonal’ formation. This formation was also known as the 4-2-4 formation.

The diagonal formation was a departure from both the traditional 2-3-5 and WM formations individually, but oddly combined aspects of both. The formation maintained the aggressive nature of the 2-3-5 formation, but was still able to maintain some of the defensive and versatile structure of the WM formation. The diagonal formation had four defenders, two defensive midfielders, two attacking midfielders, and two forwards. The diagonal formation was an adaptation of the WM formation but instead of the square formed at the center of the field by the inside forwards and half-wings, the players formed a parallelogram with a (singular) inside forward shifted closer to the attackers of one side.

The diagonal formation was constructed to utilize Brazil's innate fluidity and skill possessed by talented players like ‘Zizinho’ and ‘Jayme’. The diagonal formation allowed Brazil to play more offensively at the point of the attack, while also supporting their defense to oppose explosive counter attacks. The diagonal formation was also quite versatile and easily adapted to counteract opposing team’s talents due to the natural imbalance of the formation, meaning a ‘flip’ of the interval parallelogram of the formation could exploit weakness or expose glaring holes in less talented and less balanced opposing teams [2]. The diagonal formation was incredibly successful when paired with the talented Brazilian national team, ultimately helping Brazil win the World Cup in 1958, 1962, and 1970.
