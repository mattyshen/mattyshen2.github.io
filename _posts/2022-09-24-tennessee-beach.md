Catching the sunrise! Surprisingly nice despite the sun rising on the East and not on the East.

Next up on the agenda was Tennessee Valley Cove, also known as Tennessee beach in Marin.  My friends and I decided to go out to watch the sunrise, which meant we had to leave Berkeley around 5 am. We got there around 6 am, and began walking down the path that led us to the Cove. It was pretty dark, but as the sun began to rise, we could make out the cliffs that we would soon be standing up on. Right before we reached the cove, there was a lagoon-like body of water that was surrounded by reeds that contained cranes and other wildlife. We reached the sand, but it was really more like small Pebbles. We decided that we would get in the water after and decided to hike up to the cliff so that we can see the ocean as the sun rose.
 
It took around 20 minutes and it was very vertical, but very worth it. The crisp air cut our breath, as we passed old military batteries from the United States protecting its western coast during the World Wars. There was a warning sign that told us to not go any higher, but we decided the view was worth it, so we marched near the edge of the cliff as we finally made it to our destination. We set up shop as color had begun to transform the sky, and you could see the ocean below in a different colored hue. 

It was blue, but the pink sky reflecting off the ocean made it look green. There was little ripples in the ocean, but the ocean was relatively calm. You could see general wave trends spanning out into the horizon but up close it seemed nothing more ordinary then a bathtub. 

We watched the sunrise until pink lit across the sky, and decided to head down. In the words of Josh Davis, we decided to get in because we were at the beach. We dropped our bags down and stripped down into shorts, running into the ocean as fast as possible. It was still 7 a.m. and we thought the cold water would give us a shock to wake up, and it did --  I was wide awake.

We had trouble standing, the waves kept pushing us over and sucking us in. It felt like I didn't know how to stand. I kept on trying to go out farther but it almost felt like I was being glued into the spot that I originally started, no matter which direction I tried to head. It was like the ocean was telling me what to do, as the waves lapped up onto my legs.

It was surprising because from above the ocean seemed so calm, but below it was violent.

Luckily we didn't go too far in the ocean. We came back in and decided to head home for some breakfast. As we left the beach we realized that we walked by a sign that said “Warning: Riptides.”

I'm quite glad we didn't get too far into the ocean.
