I just got back from visiting the Golden Gate Bridge for a field trip assignment. I figured I'd use this field trip opportunity to write a little bit in a blog post about what I'd observed over the ocean. First off, the stay was very foggy. The cars were driving through the fog, but we had a very crisp and clear view of the water from the bridge. We noticed currents and channels, which was prompted in the field trip assignment, but we also noticed these pockets -- almost bubble like -- of still water that was centered amongst this moving water. 

There were a lot of these pockets dispersed or clustered about and they didnâ€™t seem to really move at all. I am not quite sure what they are, and it didn't really make too much sense to me as water should either be flowing in or out -- not at a standstill.

It was also interesting to observe that the strength of the currents at the North end of the bridge were different than the currents at the South end of the bridge. The North seem to be stronger;  if I were to infer on the reason why, I would guess something along the lines of the positioning of the Moon creating high tides progressing from the North to the South and South to North at various times. 

The walk overall was pretty tiring, and walking North to South with the traffic in our face was pretty intense and loud. However on the way back what the car is traveling with us, I could hardly notice them tossing and was able to enjoy the scenic view in the fresh air more.
