My friends and I decided to head out to South San Francisco again and visit Pacifica State Beach. We went on a quick hike across the coast above the Taco Bell Cantina, enjoyed the waves crashing against the rocky cliffs down below. Standing on one of the higher points on the cliffs, you could see the water change color as you look farther and farther out towards the horizon. I believe this was due to the sand beds,  but also perhaps upwelling.

We eventually made her way to the beach and had a nice stop at the Taco Bell Cantina. When  lunch was finished, we made our way to the beach. Here I saw Surfers and children playing in the water. I recalled me surfing a couple miles down at Montara Beach, getting violently thrashed around just the day before. After relaxing in the Sun for a bit and listening to the waves peacefully crash against the beach, I decided to get in.

It was quite sunny and I knew the water would be cold, so I decided to sprint into the water. Unfortunately, unlike Montara, Pacifica State Beach has decently sized stones dispersed closer towards the water. Some of these rocks, hidden by the water, poses as threats to my feet.

I sprinted without recognizing this, and stepped on a rock which bruised and cut up my foot. Luckily the cold water numbed it for a while as I waded around in the water. This water was a lot more relaxing the Montara, but a little bit more dicier than Muir beach.

We eventually made our way through the tunnel to watch the sunset. You could see from high above, the waves pulling and pushing below, leaving their white trails across the sand bed.
