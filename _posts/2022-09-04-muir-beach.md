"When you visit the beach, you got to get in!" - Josh Davis (us visiting Muir Beach during Covid 2020)

Muir beach is one of my favorite beaches in California.

This beach holds some sentimental memories from my time during covid, as some of my roommates (childhood friends) and I would visit this beach to relax and de-stress during the online semester. 

This time, I visited alone, walking down the wooden bridge that elevated me above the swamp-like (dried up, albeit) lowlands. I strolled by people walking their dogs, and families enjoying the nature, making my way  down to the sandbeds near the beach.

I made my way down to the beach, and stood in the middle of the sand taking all of the ocean in. It was a beautiful scene as the waves lightly washed up and down the beach, as people walked by with their bare feet and dogs returned to their owners from splashing in water.

I progressed closer to the water, and decided to explore the hidden cove to the right of Muir beach. I climbed over the rocky terain until I made my way to the secluded second landing on the beach. I decided to get in the water, and decided running in as fast as possible would be the best way to get over the mentle hurdle of the water.

I leaped in and threw my body in so I would experience all the cold at one time. The waves kept rocking me back and forth, but when I made my way farther out, it become more peaceful and I could almost float with my head back. The water was very chilly so I could not stay in very long, but it was very therapeutic -- a good way to clear my head.

I swam back in and dried off. I noticed some sea creatures attached to the rocks near the water, that would be submerged during high tide. The creatures looked almost like a dark green sea anemone that would contract when I would touched it.

I shivered my back to my car, with wet, and salty hair.
