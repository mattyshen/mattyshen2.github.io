In the early 19th century within the Meiji era, soccer was introduced to Japan by English military officers. Soccer caught on quickly by the early 20th century as seen in the creation of the Japanese Football Association (1921), becoming a relatively well received sport. In the late 20th century, soccer integrated into the Japanese lifestyle – especially in the education system – as a way to educate oneself about and engage with Western culture and “maintain the nation’s wealth and strength” [1] by investing in the youth’s physical and mental development.


In the early 20th century, Japanese soccer began developing a unique style, as most regions did. Unlike Brazil and their specific 4-2-4 formations as I discussed in the previous blog, Japan was not known for developing an explicit formation that revolutionized soccer. However, Japan did utilize it’s innate strengths of their culture to restructure the way they embraced and played the game. 


The strengths in Japanese soccer play did not simply just begin during the game, but rather was a culmination of the entire process, starting with training and education. Japanese players typically trained throughout their youth and education system as classmates and teammates, which allowed them to develop bonds that fostered camaraderie and teamwork – vital attributes for success during games. Japanese teams also emphasized that their players be technically disciplined by being fit, agile, and possessing quick reflexes, which are all crucial to minimizing errors and exploiting weaknesses in opposing teams formations and structures. Much of this emphasis stems from Asian and Japanese culture and values, specifically discipline (and self-discipline), respect, and teamwork. These programs utilized strengths and qualities from a multitude of areas, including cross-training like martial arts and Samurai class, which improved players’ balance, coordination, and reaction time. These specific characteristics, emphasized through repetitive technical exercises, laid the foundation for a unique style of play compared to the status quo of soccer at the time.


Emphasis on fitness, agility, and quick reflexes allowed Japanese players and teams to adopt a play style that relied on a high and heavy pressing game that would disrupt an opposing team’s buildup play. Japanese teams utilized their agility-based strengths by using wing positions to create more opportunities and space for attacking, and this same strength allowed them to apply aggressive pressure while on defense. The Japanese philosophy of discipline and teamwork, as it influenced training, also allowed for this style of play to be successful. Each player had a responsibility to their teammate of being physically strong in terms of agility and reaction times, as well as mentally strong to know one’s role and what position one needs to be in for this system to work, specifically such that “One should be aware of one’s role within the team, assume responsibility and cooperate” [1]. This difficult, yet promising if implemented correctly play style requires a lot of running, cooperation, and anticipation to cut off passing lanes to put the team into positions to counterattack. This style also exploited the lack of fluidity and agility in some opposing team’s play, which allowed their own pressure to disrupt opposing rhythm and counterattacks, providing opportunities to capitalize on forced mistakes.


This discipline in training and in strategy that Japanese players possessed and played with also provided another inherent advantage. The agility, quickness, and endurance, paired with the respect and teamwork of Japanese culture, allowed Japanese teams to constantly control the pace of the game through quick but controlled actions. Quick passes and swift movement allowed teams to contort opposing team’s formations and structures, allowing fast and disciplined players to exploit undisciplined and de-structured defenses.


The integration of values in the training and play style of Japanese soccer teams highlights the impact that cultural and athletic traditions have on the way that soccer is played and adopted in different parts of the world, specifically Japan. Yet, despite Japan’s adopting and growing of a sport introduced to them by the Western world, Japanese, and Asian, players still struggled to gain acceptance into the global soccer world. For example, the Director of Youth Academy at a Premier Club stated that they’re “sure there may be one or two people in every walk of life, at every club, that may not fancy Asian kids for one particular reason or another, but we would recruit Asian kids if they were good enough” where in most clubs state they are ‘color blind,’ – which is commonly dismantled as a “public coverup of institutional racism” [2]. There is much work to be done in increasing diversity in soccer across the globe, yet it is definitely encouraging seeing success from Asian athletes (Son Heung-Min, Shoetai Ohtani) increase exposure and acceptance of diversity.
