## Montara State Beach

---

I went surfing with some old friends from high school and we decided to check out Montara State beach.

The skies were gray, but there was something lively about Monstara. We made our way down the narrow pathway, surrounded by tall dirt walls, that almost seemed to be formed by water trickling down to the beach, balancing our boards above our heads or on our hips.

As we made our way to the beach, we could feel the slight thickness, but also freshness, of the ocean air. The waves crashed iteratively into the sand mounds that made the beach.

We jogged down to the waves, set our boards down, guided them deeper to the rough waters, and rolled onto the boards.

Paddling the water was tough, the waves were relentless and rough. I followed the technique that I was taught: to dive under the big waves and upward-dog the smaller ones. Eventually, I had weathered the storm and was far out enough that the waves weren't crashing yet. Looking out to the horizon, I could see big waves beginning to form, looking like ominous lumps in the murkey blue green water. Sitting on the board with the occasional breastroke kick allowed me to balance over these dveeloping waves.

I surfed the waves I could, but ended up close to shore. I attempted to recycle the way I originally had gotten out from land, but the waves were crashing too frequently. It felt like the waves were crashing from different directions, knocking me off my original direction (I did end up learning that this is not possible, as the waves crash parallel to the beach -- maybe the waves were reorienting me after each crash, which made it feel like the waves were coming from different directions). It felt like I was taking one step forward, just to take two steps backward. The waves began crashing on top of me, and even ducking under the waves would leave me farther away from the open water.

After a while of relentlessly battling the waves, I began to freeze up. The wetsuit I was wearing was of low quality, and I decided it was best to get out. I sat on the beach watching the waves crash as I chattered my teeth.
