They did not get in the water, sadly.

Stinson Beach is one of my all-time favorite beaches. In high school my water polo team would visit Stinson Beach as a team bonding event before our season started. We used to start with a quick workout, followed by a quick swim, and concluded with a barbecue. After lunch, some of us would get into the ocean and body surf the big waves that Stinson Beach created.

When I visited recently, I recalled the big waves that had always existed a Stinson Beach. We used to go swimming in the ocean as a team and the shelf dropped very steeply after a couple feet into the ocean. You could be completely floating, treading water, and have no clue where the bottom was. Yet, it felt like this created the best waves in the best opportunity to bodysurf yourself to land. These waves are big and powerful, but they are also gentle and predictable. 

I looked around the beach was very flat. It reminded me of the pictures my friend had sent from  Massachusetts --  the beaches there are very flat with some plants that live on the boundary, swaying in the wind, between the parking lots and the sand.

The sand at Stinson Beach seemed finer more free than any other sand any other Beach I have experience. I decided to walk along the coast,  with the wind blowing in my hair the subtle crashing of the waves in my ears.
